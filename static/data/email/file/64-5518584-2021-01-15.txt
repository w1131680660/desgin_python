Hi,

I was building one of your desks (DNZB-47/55) and one of the parts (D) is
missing the threads to secure the feet. One "D" part is missing threads in
both feet, while the other "D" part was manufactured correctly.

We obviously need a new part sent to us.

Attached in this email is our Amazon order and two photos of the defective
part.

I hope to hear from you soon,

Adri
