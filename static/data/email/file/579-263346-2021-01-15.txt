Dear,

Would you please resend the attachment in unzipped format? We are unable to open the zip file. Thanks 

Meanwhile, please take note that we have received several client inquires mentioning they are unable to register MobilePASS to their new phone (especially if it is Huawei phone). We are investigating the issue now. This may take time but in the meantime you may continue to work with our CS team and see if it is resolvable. Sorry for all the inconvenience caused.

Best Regards,

Hi CitiService Team
Hope this mail finds you well.
Through your help, we got the activation codes on Tuesday(12 Jan), but we failed every time when trying to activate the app on the new phone. 
It is very weird because we followed the instrcution strictly, and we think we got enough practice when we successfully activated the app on the old phone (we failed, then you resent the new codes, and then we made it successfully）
We are wondering if special operation are requested, e.g., unbind the app on the old phone or something.

Here attached screen copies for your reference, we are eagerly looking forward to your prompt solution and we strongly demand for the reason that failed.

Thanks and regards.
