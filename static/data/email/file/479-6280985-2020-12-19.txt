Hello,

I brought a Joiscope 40" computer desk via Amazon (my order from Amazon
attached). When I got the desk, I found that part G is defective. There is
a crack in the corner of the leg peice (image attached). The 2 peices of
metal have completely separated; it is only held together by the welding at
the corners. It appears to be defective welding as the angle of the bend is
more than 90Â°.

Can you please send me a replacement piece G? My address is Unit 1702, 30
Roehampton Avenue, Toronto, ON, M4P0B9.

Can you please let me know when the replacement will arrive? If it takes
too long, I will return to Amazon.

Regards,

Danny
