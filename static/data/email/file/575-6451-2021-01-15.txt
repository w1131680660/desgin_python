Hi there,

I recently purchased a 20 cube from Joiscope, and upon opening the box I
have noticed that I appear to be missing 4 A2 parts (35 cm by 45 cm
sheets).

I only received 45 A2 sheets, where all the cubes having the necessary
walls would require 49 A2 sheets. I understand that perhaps it is implied
that, as in the picture on Amazon, I am supposed to not have an A2 in every
possible spot, however the picture at least has 46 A2 sheets on the model,
so that means at the very least I am missing one, unless the product you
are selling is inconsistent with the picture used to market it.

I appreciate your notes on the box and instructions saying that you are
happy to send replaced parts to ensure I have a fully functional product
and I look forward to receiving it.

I would appreciate it if you would confirm that this message has been
received and that the replacement is on the way.

Best,

Holden Hershenson
