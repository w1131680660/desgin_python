Hello,

I got a message from facebook messenger from your company to buy a table
and offered me a refund after the amazon review. I gave a 5 star review
with video and after that, nobody responded in facebook messenger and not
issued refunding. Here are the screenshots of facebook messenger.

Please let me know the next steps regarding this. Do I need to talk with
Amazon or you can take care of this?. Please let me know quickly.
