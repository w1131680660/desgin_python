Hi,

Thank you for your reply. The second option works for me. I have attached
an image of the 5-star review I left on Amazon under the table.

Please have the replacement item sent to me at the following address:
4404 186th St SE, Bothell, WA 98012

Please include a shipment tracking number so that I can track it.

Thank you for your help and fast response.

Sincerely,
Shaun Keefe
