I am following up on my previous message about the desk that I received that was damaged during shipping. I have not yet received a replacement part and have not even had a response from you, and it has now been 2 weeks since I contacted you. Please advise when I should expect to receive a replacement part (part A desktop) so that I can replace the damaged part of my desk.Thank you.Doug Follettdfollett@garlic.com408-425-2264Sent via the Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G, an AT&T 5G smartphone
