I like the solution of entering a 5 star rating in Amazon and you in 
return send a new desk from Amazon.    I have already entered the review 
and my positive comments and submitted to Amazon.  Amazon indicated it 
may take up to 3 days for them to process and post my review.  Once it 
is posted, I will take a screen shot and e-mail it to you.

Thank you.
