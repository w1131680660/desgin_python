I submitted the 5 star review and this is what showed after. I don’t know how long it will take but I would appreciate it if I could be sent the product as soon as you guys receive it or even before if possible.

Dear customer，
Sorry that we do not have spare parts in stock, but we can send replacement parts from our Asian factories directly to your address which will take about three months because of the impact of COVID-19.

Due to the long waiting time for replacement parts, recently we have a special offer: we will send a new product to customer in goodwill as long as customers can submit five-star reviews on Amazon and send back the screenshot. We will arrange delivery once we receive the screenshot. Customer will receive the package within a week as we still have some products in stock on Amazon. The positive comments and support from customers are significant to us.If you like this solution, please let me know and reply us with your name,address,postal code and phone number.

Let us know your preference. Looking forward your reply.

Sincerely

Subject: ALL- Missing all nuts and bolts

Good morning, my package got delivered 2 days ago and I wanted to assemble it with my Dad for my Mom as her Christmas present. We just opened it and found that the nuts, bolts, screws etc. were missing from the box. We are highly disappointed because we now can't return it due to it being fully opened and don't have the money to buy another desk.

Please reach out to us.
