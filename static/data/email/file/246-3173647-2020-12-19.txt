Hello,

I recently purchased the desk above on amazon for my apartment. While putting it together, I discovered that parts A and E are defective and don't have the required holes for assembly. We have double checked the orientation and are sure that some of the holes have been damaged/missing. Is there a way to replace these two parts?

Thank you,
