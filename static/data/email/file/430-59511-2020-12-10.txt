Dear Seller,

From 1st January 2021, businesses moving goods between the UK and EU will need to make customs declarations.

This means that, on both sides of the British Channel, goods will not be able to leave the port until they are customs cleared.

Tomorrow, Thursday 10th December, join your host Tom Meek for the third episode of the AVASK Brexit Webinar Series, which will focus on import/export and customs in post-Brexit Britain.
