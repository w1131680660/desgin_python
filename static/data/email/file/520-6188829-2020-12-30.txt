Hello,

I have purchased the JOISCOPE 55" computer desk with 2-tier shelves ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083PQTQ5N ) off of Amazon ( Order # 111-7561798-4177801 ) on December 23, 2020. The majority of the parts are in acceptable condition minus the vintage oak finish table top, which is damaged in the corners. The supporting covers were broken upon arrival, and the outside of the box is damaged as well. I've included pictures of the broken corners, an undamaged corner for comparison, the plastic covers, and the packaging. Would you be able to send me a replacement for this table top?

Please let me know if you need any additional information!
Thank you kindly,
Maria Rigas
