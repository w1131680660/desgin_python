Good afternoon,
We purchased the Joiscope Computer Desk DNZC-40 and have attempted to assemble it, but we are unable to screw in the casters into the bottom of the H Leg due it not being threaded. Do we need to send the desk back or can you send us a new H Leg?Â  The reference numbers on the box, CTN 83-66-9.2, STN+BK

Best regards,
Heather Coatneyhmc565@yahoo.com
