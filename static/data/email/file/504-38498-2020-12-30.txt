  Dear
  customer，
    Sorry that we do not have spare parts in stock, but we can send replacement
  parts from our Asian factories directly to your address which will take about
  three months because of the impact of COVID-19.
    
    Due to the long waiting time for replacement parts, recently we have a
  special offer: we will send a new product to customer in goodwill as long as
  customers can submit five-star reviews on Amazon and send back the
  screenshot. We will arrange delivery once we receive the screenshot. Customer
  will receive the package within a week as we still have some products in
  stock on Amazon. The positive comments and support from customers are
  significant to us.If you like this solution, please let me know and reply us
  with your name,address,postal code and phone number.
    
    Let us know your preference. Looking forward your reply.
    
    Sincerely
